An HTML escaping scenario
=========================

Test HTML escapes in IMPLEMENTS code. At some point after Debian 9 was
released, the Python markdown library yarn uses started to HTML escape
code blocks. This breaks any shell scripts that use redirection. Make
sure this works.

    SCENARIO html escaping
    THEN greet

    IMPLEMENTS THEN greet
    echo hello > /dev/null
